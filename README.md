# üí∞ Finance Data Analysis (Dummy Dataset)

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates **financial data analysis** using a **synthetic dataset** created with Python.  
The dataset simulates monthly transactions across customers, regions, and product categories.  

The goal is to practice **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization** techniques that are commonly applied in real-world financial analytics.

The notebook covers:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - `.info()`, `.describe()`  
2. **Monthly Trends**  
   - Revenue & Profit line chart  
3. **Regional Performance**  
   - Total revenue by region (bar chart)

## üîç Key Observations
- **Revenue and Profit** show steady growth over months.  
- **North and South regions** contribute the most to revenue.  
- **Mutual Funds and Loans** dominate revenue share among product categories.  
- **Profit is highly correlated with Revenue**, while Expenses negatively impact Profit.
